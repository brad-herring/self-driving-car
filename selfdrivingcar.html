        <p>In this website you will go through the process of designing and
      building a self-driving car that can avoid walls and drive on its own.</p>

        <p>This self-driving car may seem like quite a technological feat.
        However, it is actually simpler than you might think to build a robot
        that has these futuristic capabilities!</p>

    <p>Robots are designed to automate physical
    tasks that humans command it to do. In order to translate human
    language into something that the robot can read, you need to use what
    is called code. Code is interpreted by your computer and can be used
    in the programming of robots.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Most of the code that is used in writing programs for robots is in the C
    programming language. It would be especially beneficial for this project to
    at least be familiar with the fundamentals of C and programming in general.
